Guild Wars 2 Music
=======

A collection of AutoHotKey scripts for Guild Wars 2 which allow you to easily play songs or short tunes within the game using the in-game instruments.

Easy Setup
=======
Install Guild Wars 2 if you have not already.  Install AutoHotKey if you have not already.  Place all the scripts in a folder on your desktop or use a shortcut in your taskbar or wherever to make them easy to access.  Run the game and get your chosen instrument equipped.  Alt+tab out of the game and double-click the script you want to activate.  The script will bring you back into the game and wait about 2 seconds before initiating the notes.  As the script is running or while the notes are playing, you can stop the script by pressing Esc.  Note that scripts are designed for specific instruments.

Completely Free
